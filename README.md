# meme-soundboard

This is a soundboard of all the dumb things my friends and I like to reference plus a few other fun additions.

The soundboard utilizes the `pygame` and `tkinter` modules.

The code currently only works for Unix filesystem paths but can easily be changed for Windows, (switch `/` for `\`)
